# set_resolution

This function sets the resolution of the Minecraft window. If both `width` and
`height` are 0, the Minecraft window will instead stretch to fit the bounds of
the waywall window (and will continue to do so as the window is resized).

<div class="warning">

Make sure your resolutions follow the [leaderboard rules]! You may only use a
single resolution which extends past the bounds of your monitor, and it is **not
allowed** to use a resolution greater than 16384 pixels in width or height.

</div>

### Arguments

  - `width`: number
  - `height`: number

### Return values

None

> This function cannot be called during startup.
